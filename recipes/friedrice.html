        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>Fried rice is a popular and versatile dish enjoyed across many cultures, especially in Asian cuisine. It's made by stir-frying cooked rice with a mix of vegetables, sauces, and often eggs or meat. Originally a way to use up leftover rice, it has evolved into a flavorful, standalone meal that's quick and easy to prepare. The combination of soy sauce, garlic, and a hot pan gives it a signature savory taste.</p>
        <p>You can make fried rice as simple or as loaded as you like. Add eggs for protein, toss in leftover veggies, or even stir in chicken, shrimp, or tofu. It’s perfect for a fast lunch, dinner, or a satisfying midnight snack. With a few pantry staples and some cold rice, you can whip up this dish in under 15 minutes.</p>
