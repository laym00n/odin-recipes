        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>Lasagna is a traditional Italian dish known for its rich layers of pasta, savory meat or vegetable fillings, creamy béchamel sauce, and melted cheese. Originating from Italy, particularly the region of Emilia-Romagna, it has become a beloved comfort food around the world. The classic version, lasagna alla Bolognese, features a slow-cooked meat ragù layered with pasta sheets and béchamel sauce, then baked until golden and bubbling.</p>
        <p>Over time, lasagna has evolved to include countless variations, catering to different tastes and dietary needs. Some recipes swap out meat for vegetables like spinach, zucchini, or mushrooms, while others use ricotta cheese instead of béchamel. Vegan and gluten-free adaptations are also common today. Regardless of the ingredients, lasagna remains a hearty, crowd-pleasing dish that showcases the power of simple, well-layered ingredients.</p>
